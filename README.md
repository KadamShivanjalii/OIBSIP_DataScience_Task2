# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task2

## Project Title
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, distribution, and patterns present in a dataset. EDA is an essential step in data science that helps in identifying trends, relationships, and potential issues in data before applying machine learning models.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset using statistical and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Dataset
A publicly available dataset was used for performing exploratory analysis. The dataset contains numerical features suitable for statistical analysis and visualization.

## Methodology
- Imported required Python libraries  
- Loaded the dataset into a DataFrame  
- Examined dataset structure and summary statistics  
- Identified missing values  
- Analyzed data distributions  
- Visualized correlations and patterns using plots  

## Results
The analysis provided clear insights into data distribution, feature relationships, and potential trends present in the dataset.

## Outcome
This project helped in developing a strong understanding of exploratory data analysis techniques and their importance in the data science workflow.
